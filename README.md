**Choosing the Right Pearl Necklace Set: What to Look For**
Not all pearl necklace sets are created equal. Here’s what you should consider before adding one to your collection:

### ✅ Type of Pearls
Freshwater pearls are budget-friendly and perfect for daily wear. South Sea pearls are luxurious and ideal for weddings or high-end events.

* Choker (14–16 inches): Great for modern wear
* Princess (17–19 inches): Classic and versatile
* Matinee (20–24 inches): Best for formal looks
* Opera (28–34 inches): Statement-making and trendy
  
At jpearls, we offer all these varieties so you can pick one that suits your style.

### ✅ Design Aesthetic
Are you into traditional charm or minimal elegance? A modern pearl necklace offers a clean and sleek design, while a trendy pearl necklace set may feature colored pearls, gemstone additions, or layered chains.
